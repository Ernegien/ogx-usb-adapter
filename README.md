# ogx-usb-adapter

This is the cheapest possible implementation of an original Xbox USB adapter PCB that plugs directly into the front panel controller ports, modeled after Team Xodus' original version released many years ago. If you want to build an [endgame](https://github.com/XboxDev/endgame-exploit)-based software loader package (USB drive included) for under $1 in semi-bulk quantities this is your chance.

Defaults are primarily acceptable with your choice of quantity/color (refer to the image below for specifics at the time) except for thickness, which **must be 1.0-1.2 millimeters**! Deburring is optional, but probably desired if going with 1.2 mm thickness, otherwise it's a bit snug.
